## Remote Guide ##

MythDroid has 3 types of remote, detailed below. The following applies to
all of them:

If your device has a trackball it will perform the same actions as dragging.

If your device has a hardware keyboard, keystrokes made on it whilst in a
remote screen will be passed to the relevant frontend.

### Nav Remote ###

The Nav Remote allows you to navigate around the MythTV interface. If you
navigate to a location such as watching tv or viewing a recording, the TV
Remote will automatically start. Pressing menu will allow you to change the
interface from button to gesture or vice versa. In the gesture interface, the
following gestures are recognised:

  * Swipe - equivalent to pressing the relevant directional key once
  * Drag - sends a directional key at a fixed interval of distance dragged
  * Tap - equivalent to pressing the enter key

The default Nav remote style (gesture or standard) can be configured in
MythDroid's [settings](SettingsGuide.md).

### TV Remote ###

In the gesture interface, the following gestures are recognised:

  * Swipe left / right - skip backwards or forwards
  * Swipe up / down - browses channels in livetv, jumps backwards or forwards when watching a recording
  * Drag left / right - seek backwards or forwards, seeks faster the further you drag
  * Drag up / down - volume control
  * Tap - pause / unpause

The menu button gives you the choice of showing the OSD menu on the frontend
or switching interfaces (button or gesture). It also allows you to move playback to a different frontend or to the Android device.

The default TV remote style (gesture or standard) can be configured in
MythDroid's [settings](SettingsGuide.md).

### Music Remote ###

The music remote employs both buttons and gestures. The gestures supported are:

  * Swipe left / right - previous or next track
  * Swipe up / down - move selection up or down
  * Drag left / right - seek backwards or forwards
  * Drag up / down - volume control
  * Tap - pause / resume

Pressing the menu button allows you to enter the playlist editor, change the
visualiser, fullscreen the visualiser, toggle shuffle and repeat modes and open
the on screen menu on the frontend.
