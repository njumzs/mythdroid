## How to get involved ##

Check out the resources below and then get in touch (via the development mailing list or IRC). The [issues list](http://code.google.com/p/mythdroid/issues/list) should give a reasonable overview of what's being worked on but it's definitely worth a quick check that you're not about to duplicate any existing effort. The current developers will be more than happy to discuss your ideas and help you to get them incorporated.
